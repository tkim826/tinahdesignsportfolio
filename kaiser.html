            Over 30,000,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year in the United States alone. Ensuring that the proper hospital
            equipment is safe to use and in the right place at the right time is critical. We partnered with Kaiser Permanente’s
            Southern California Medical Imaging Technology and Informatics department to help create a more efficient inventory
            management tool for hospital equipment across the entire Southern California region.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The internal website is fragmented and outdated, requiring several steps to complete simple tasks.
            </li>

            <li>

              Form procedures have not been put in place, resulting in the input of incorrect information and a convoluted inventory system.
            </li>
            <li>

              Employees are not notified when an action is required to be taken on their end. This results in prolonged time for procedures
              to be completed.

          <strong>Process </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="small-text black">
          We followed the Design Thinking methodogy and started the process with research to gain an understanding of our user’s needs.
          Through academic research, stakeholder, and user interviews, we were able to define our problems and opportunities.
          As we moved into our ideating phase, we explored numerous design solutions, and then prototyped and tested our
          solutions through each step. The iterative process allowed us to test, prototype, and refine our prototype.

          <strong>Research: </strong>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Academic Research: </strong>The UCI team gathered relevant scholarly research articles on a variety of topics
              on the industry standard for the digital implementation of workflow tools in the medical field and data management
              in medical systems. This domain knowledge would help inform our game plan and strategy in the early stages
              of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stakeholder Interviews: </strong>Six stakeholder interviews were conducted, each approximately an hour in length.
              These sessions helped the team develop an understanding of the target user groups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tree Testing: </strong>Using the research platform,
              <em>Optimal Sort</em>, the research team drafted a tree-test study and it was completed by eighteen Kaiser employees.
              The purpose of this study was to validate the client team’s optimal depiction of the site’s information architecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Opportunity Analysis: </strong>Based on the information that was gathered in previous research, the team was
              able to identify many different points of actionable change. In order to pinpoint critical and/or priority
              items, the team examined “competitors” that are implementing the features and functions that the myMITI website
              needs to consider in the future.

          <strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong>
          <em>
            <p class="black small-text">
              We interviewed a variety of people in different job roles via Microsoft Teams. The insights gathered from these interviews
              were used to inform our personas, storyboards and scenarios.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Finding 1: </strong>Communication between functional groups is via email, phone, and in-person. Currently,
              there is no notification system within myMITI for new work related tasks and items.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Finding 2: </strong>Users would like to be able to see their assigned tasks in a centralized location:
              “Worklist”.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Finding 3: </strong>There is no quality control or checks and balances to ensure that information is input

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Searching for a system.

                </ul>
                As a part of these flows, we added features such as the

              <p class="black small-text">
                Based on the results gathered in the formative usability evaluation, there were some key insights that needed to be verified.
                The survey questionnaire was distributed through
                <em>google forms</em> to 15 Kaiser employees. Based on the results, the team was able to steer the designs in
                the right direction. The followup survey was deployed to dive deeper into the following topics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Work List Icons: </strong>The team determined that using standard icons would mitigate interpretation issues.
                  Four standard icons were tested, and it was found that a “flag” icon best represented “Important Items.”


                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pushback Mode: Toggle Location</strong>
                  The toggle used to initiate Pushback Mode had potential to be lost in the page fold. Three button locations were evaluated,
                  and it was found that the original location of the button was preferred by users. We resolved the possibility
                  of losing the toggle by making the top area of the forms fixed when scrolling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>System Lookup: Search Bars</strong>
                  Majority of users gravitated towards the top navigation search bar when searching for a system by system number. Users also
                  noted that the duplicate search bars served the same function.

                were to evaluate the perceived usefulness, clarity and general usability. Using a combination of stakeholder

              <strong>The Outcome</strong>
              <p class="black small-text ">
                Our goal was to take Kaiser’s internal website and make it functional, intuitive, and simple to use. Our final usability
                test showed positive feedback: Our data showed that users had a
                <strong>
                  <em>100% task success and completion rate</em>
                </strong>for all four core tasks, with perceived usefulness. However, we found that there was some opportunities for
                improvement in helping users with comprehension of the new features. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Opportunity 1: Onboarding </strong>Some users noted that some new features were not easy to notice. An
                  opportunity for better visibility and learnability would be to add an onboarding process, so users can
                  learn the new features quickly and maximize the website’s new features. We added onboarding screens of
                  the key new functions to so users would instantly understand how to use them.



                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Opportunity 2: Notifications </strong>
                  We added a notification feature to give instant, visible feedback regarding worklist tasks. The myMITI website would alert
                  employees via email, but we felt that allowing the user to also receive the communication through their
                  current myMITI page would help. The new notifications feature that would keep users informed of any new
                  worklist or status update.

            Our final prototype with Kaiser resulted in positive feedback. Their developers have
