                    implement
                    workflow and data management functions. We then mapped out the curret site with opportunities for
                    improvement.

                        The survey questionnaire was distributed through <em>google forms</em> to 15 Kaiser employees.
                        Based

                        able to steer the designs in the right direction. The followup survey was deployed to dive

                          mitigate
                          interpretation issues. Four standard icons were tested, and it was found that a “flag” icon
                          best
                          represented “Important Items.”

                          The toggle used to initiate Pushback Mode had potential to be lost in the page fold. Three
                          button
                          locations were evaluated, and it was found that the original location of the button was
                          preferred
                          by users. We resolved the possibility of losing the toggle by making the top area of the
                          forms
                          fixed when scrolling.

                        <li><strong>System Lookup: Search Bars</strong>
                          Majority of users gravitated towards the top navigation search bar when searching for a
                          system
                          by
                          system number. Users also noted that the duplicate search bars served the same function.

                        We implemented a final usability evaluation through <em>validately.com</em> to evaluate the
                        adjusted
                        designs and implementations.
                        At this stage, the research goals were to evaluate the perceived usefulness, clarity and
                        general
                        usability.

                        Using a combination of stakeholder feedback and the results gathered in the formative
                        evaluation
                        and followup survey, a finalized prototype was completed. This asset was used for the final
                        usability evaluation. Users were given a set of four core tasks:


                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Navigating the Worklist</li>
                        <li>2. Using Pushback Mode on a Form Error</li>
                        <li>3. Looking up System information using a Search Filter
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          4. Initiating Action on a specific system
                        </li>

                      <strong>The Outcome</strong>
                      <p class="black small-text ">
                        Our goal was to take Kaiser’s internal website and make it functional, intuitive, and simple
                        to
                        use.
                        Our final usability test showed positive feedback: Our data showed that users had a
                        <strong><em>100%
                            task success and completion rate</em> </strong>for all four core tasks, with perceived
                        usefulness. However, we found that there was some opportunities for improvement in helping
                        users
                        with comprehension of the new features. </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Opportunity 1: Onboarding </strong>Some users noted that some new features were not
                          easy
                          to notice. An opportunity for better visibility and learnability would be to add an
                          onboarding
                          process, so users can learn the new features quickly and maximize the website’s new
                          features. We
                          added onboarding screens of the key new functions to so users would instantly understand how
                          to
                          use them.



                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Opportunity 2: Notifications </strong>
                          We added a notification feature to give instant, visible feedback regarding worklist tasks.
                          The
                          myMITI website would alert employees via email, but we felt that allowing the user to also
                          receive
                          the communication through their current myMITI page would help. The new notifications
                          feature that would keep users informed of any new worklist or status update.

                    Our final prototype with Kaiser resulted in positive feedback.
                    I'm proud and excited to learn that their developers have started to work on putting our designs
                    into production. The new site will be used and implemented across all of the Kaiser Permanente
                    Locations in Southern California.
